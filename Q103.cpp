//103 Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
#include <stdio.h>

int findCeil(int arr[], int n, int x) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    int ans = -1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] >= x) {
            ans = mid;         // possible ceil index
            high = mid - 1;    // try to find an even smaller element >= x
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

int main() {
    int n, x;

    scanf("%d", &n);
    int arr[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);

    scanf("%d", &x);

    int idx = findCeil(arr, n, x);
    printf("%d", idx);
